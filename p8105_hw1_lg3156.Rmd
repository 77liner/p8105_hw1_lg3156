This is my solution to hw1.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1
Create a data frame with the specified elements.
```{r}
prob1_df=
  tibble(
    samp=rnorm(10),
    samp_gt_0=samp>0,
    char_vec=c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
    factor_vec=factor(c("low","low","low","mod","mod","mod","mod","high","high","high"))
  )
```

Take the mean of each variable in my data frame.
```{r}
mean(pull(prob1_df,samp))
mean(pull(prob1_df,samp_gt_0))
mean(pull(prob1_df,char_vec))
mean(pull(prob1_df,factor_vec))
```
What works and what doesn't?
The mean function works for samp and samp_gt_0, and it doesn't work for char_vec or factor_vec. Because char_vec and factor_vec are not numeric or logical.
## Problem 2
